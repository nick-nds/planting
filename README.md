## 🌳 Quick Overview

### Zone Distribution
1. **Timber Belt (0-30m)**: 100 trees - Windbreak with Teak & Mahogany
2. **Large Fruits (30-120m)**: 140 trees - Mango, Jamun, Litchi dominated
3. **Mixed Orchard (80-120m)**: 80 trees - Guava, citrus, medium fruits  
4. **Intensive Riverside (120-150m)**: 65 trees - Banana-papaya circles

### Key Features

- **Companion Planting**: Every tree in beneficial guilds
- **Phased Implementation**: 4-year establishment plan
- **Expected Yield**: 20-30 tons/hectare at maturity

### Plant Summary by Category

| Category | Species | Trees | Purpose |
|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Timber | Teak, Mahogany | 100 | Windbreak, long-term value |
| Large Fruits | Mango, Jamun, Litchi, Jackfruit | 55 | Main production |
| Citrus | Orange, Lemon, Lime varieties | 40 | Year-round vitamin C |
| Medium Fruits | Guava, Pomegranate, Custard Apple | 65 | Diverse harvest |
| Quick Yield | Papaya, Banana | 48 | Early income (Year 1) |
| Support Species | Neem, Moringa, Mulberry | 25 | Pest control, nitrogen |
| Special Crops | Apple, Pear, Cherry, Fig | 30 | Specialty markets |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Year 1**: Establish water infrastructure, plant timber belt and banana circles
2. **Year 2**: Plant main fruit trees with companion species
3. **Year 3**: Fill remaining spaces, establish ground covers
4. **Year 4**: Complete companion planting, begin maintenance phase

## 💧 Water Infrastructure
- Main canal from river (3m wide)
- Distribution channels every 50m
- Swales between tree rows
- Estimated water need: 5,000 liters/day in summer

## 🌱 Maintenance Guidelines
- **Pruning**: November-December (post-monsoon)
- **Composting**: Continuous in banana circles
- **Pest Management**: Neem spray monthly in growing season
- **Mulching**: Pre-monsoon (May) and post-monsoon (October)
